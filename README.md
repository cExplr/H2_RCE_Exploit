```
==========================================================================================================================
==========================================================================================================================
THIS IS FOR EDUCATION PURPOSES ONLY. PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS ON ANY REAL SYSTEMS AROUND YOU AND DONT EVEN THINK ABOUT IT.
PLEASE BE RESPONSIBLE AND ETHICAL. BE REMINDED THAT IF YOU ARE CAUGHT, YOU WILL BE IN GRAVE TROUBLE. THE H2 DATABASE HAS 
VERY QUICKLY PATCHED THIS VULNERABILITY!
==========================================================================================================================
==========================================================================================================================
```

If localhost is used via SSH port forwarding, the url for H2 Database must include http://localhost:XXXX where XXXX is the port number\

usernames and passwords list are provided in case we do not know the password and wishes to bruteforce it.
Edit if you wanna use a wordlist

Once credentials are confirmed then a setup payload is used to initialize the function for executing scripts
In this case, when we input command after the setup payload is sent, a query to CALL SHELLEXEC(WHATEVERCOMMAND) will output to you the
values.


TO EXIT  GRACEFULLY, JUST TYPE    "EXIT"
